                  Reducing our carbon footprint is everyone's responsibility
                  and everyone can do their part. Did you know that by treating yourself
                  and taking advantage of the e-skyshop, you could help reduce the carbon
                  footprint of the plane that you are traveling on? Traditionally,
                  a wide selection of products is loaded on board, whether used (needed) or not.
                  Today, only the selected product will be delivered and no unnecessary stock of heavy
                  and bulky products will be transported. Don't wait any longer to see a cart passing by,
                  choose your product from a large selection, well in advance,
                  and only this product will have the privilege to be transported!
